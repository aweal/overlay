Local SIC ~amd64 overlay. 

I wouldn't trust ebuild from this overlay if I were you. It's an overlay with dirty and thoughtless hacks, just so long as the packages compile successfully. Mostly all the solutions are in bugzilla and will be in the main tree in a couple days. Once again, think about your risk, good luck.
